# vertical-lift-brige-simulation-cg-project
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT:

The bascule bridge works with a counterweight that balances the span (leaf) while the upward swing provides clearance for boat traffic.
Here, we have created a function consisting of the bascule bridge which operates to allow a boat to pass under it while a car waits for
the leaf of the bridge to swing back into its position and then passes along the bridge after the boat has sailed across.

• The bridge allows the vehicles to move on it . 
• When a ship approaches the bridge , a signal will be given to stop the movement of the vehicles over the bridge. 
• As soon as the vehicles stop,the cables start to lift the bascules up with the support of two towers. 
• Now the ship travels under the bridge without any disturbance and as soon as the ship passes the bridge area ,
the cables will lease down the bascules to make the way for road traffic.
• The lift over bridge which performs all these functions has been implemented using OpenGL functions and contains 
the Menu options and the Keyboard interface.


• *It has the following feature and performs the following features:*

--> OpenGL based bridge which lifts its roadway automatically whenever a ship sails towards it.
--> A bus travels over the bridge.
--> Other options include START ANIMATION , STOP ANIMATION and EXIT.
--> The project is implemented on C platform with the help of OpenGL in-built functions. 
--> Care is taken to provide easy-to-use mouse and keyboard interface involving an icon-based interaction.
